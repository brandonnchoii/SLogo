**Estimation:**
I expect it will take me about an hour.

I only need to update one file.

**Review:**
It took me about an hour.

No, I tried to implement this feature through an image chooser but it was being buggy so I fell back on my original plan.

I only needed to add to one file (the TopMenu) since I decided to add the option through the View MenuItem of the TopMenu.

**Analysis:**
I don't think our design was that bad. We separated out the front end pretty well.(not many dependencies)

We could have made the WorldController less cluttered. Also, the World class is cluttered as well.

It would have been tough to know exactly what class/classes to edit.
