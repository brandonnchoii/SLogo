Roles:

James: Brandon and I worked on UI together. Our first responsibilities were to the group in that we all contributed equally the the primary overall design. Afterwards, Brandon and I collaborated to design the UI layout, and implement the basic design features for Sprint 2. I worked to set up the initial UserInterface class and allowing for turtle movement to be displayed. In sprint 3, I wrote classes to move the turtle. I wrote Pen and subclasses. I wrote much of initial implementations of WorldController and Turtle. Also, I focused on using animation to move the turtle between frames. Main class focuses: UserInterface, WorldController, Turtle, Pen

Brandon: Alongside James, I worked on front end components as well as the controller. I designed the outline and architecture behind the UI and implemented many of the features such as RightPanel, LeftPanel, TopMenu, and ErrorMessage. I focused on front end aspects but also worked on WorldController to develop the relationship and communication between front end and back end. By utilizing binding, I was able to allow the user to dynamically change certain features in the program such as the background color, turtle image, and pen settings.

Thomas:

Megan: I worked on backend with Thomas. My main responsibility was the parsing, and mainly worked in the Parser and World classes. I dealt with the logic for parsing and creating commands from the user input. 

Resources: stackoverflow, javadocs

File(s) to start: Main.java

File(s) to test:

Data/Resources needed:

How to use: Refer to help page

Known flaws: To command does not work, cannot nest loops, cannot implement multiple lines of input due to problems in animation of drawing lines (would draw incorrectly, not because our program can't handle it), variable tables not completely implemented, parser design does not account for some commands.

Extra features:

Impressions: Interesting project, group worked well together overall
