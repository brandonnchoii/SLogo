Brandon: Alongside James, I worked on front end components as well as the controller. I designed the outline and architecture behind the UI and implemented many of the features such as RightPanel, LeftPanel, TopMenu, and ErrorMessage. I focused on front end aspects but also worked on WorldController to develop the relationship and communication between front end and back end. By utilizing binding, I was able to allow the user to dynamically change certain features in the program such as the background color, turtle image, and pen settings.
