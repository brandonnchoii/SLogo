Brandon: Alongside James, I worked on front end components as well as the controller. Designed the architecture behind the UI and implemented many of the features such as RightPanel, LeftPanel, TopMenu, and ErrorMessage. Focused on front end aspects but also worked on WorldController to develop the relationship and communication between front end and back end. Utilized binding to allow dynamic changes to certain features in the program such as the background color, turtle image, and pen settings.
